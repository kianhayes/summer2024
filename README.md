# Kian Hayes Summer 2024 Benedictine College Research #
This repository serves the purpose of documenting my research conducted during the summer of 2024 at Benedictine College. 

The research entails testing performance of different codes used in Computational Astrophysics, mainly utilizing Athena++. Below I detail the various directories in this repository:

## /scripts ##
Contains Python and Bash scripts that I used to streamline data processing and data collection. This is anywhere from plotting data output by Athena++ or automating iterative processes during tests.

## /athena ##
Contains various animations or plots from simulations and spreadsheets that I used to track data. 

#### Animation of the MHD Blast Problem ####

### /athena/solvers_eos_test ###
This contains files related to a test conducted to explore the performance of different solvers and Equations of state (EOS) included in Athena++

#### Data from testing the performance by time of each EOS and Solver combination ####

### /athena/processes_test ###
This contains the data and animations associated with the test I conducted exploring the performance of running a different amount of parallelized processes for a simulation. The test compares running a simulation at 1 process all the way to 32 processes.

### Animation of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Problem ###
