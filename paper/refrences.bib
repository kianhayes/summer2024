	abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods. The source code is freely available for download on the web.},

	volume = {47(89)},
	url = {https://hal.science/hal-01620642},
	abstract = {The method of characteristics used for numerical computation of solutions of fluid dynamical equations is characterized by a large degree of non standardness and therefore is not suitable for automatic computation on electronic computing machines, especially for problems with a large number of shock waves and contact discontinuities. In 1950 v. Neumann and Richtmyer proposed to use, for the solution of fluid dynamics equations, difference equations into which viscosity was introduced artificially; this has the effect of smearing out the shock wave over several mesh points. Then, it was proposed to proceed with the computations across the shock waves in the ordinary manner. In 1954, Lax published the "triangle'' scheme suitable for computation across the shock" waves. A deficiency of this scheme is that it does not allow computation with arbitrarily fine time steps (as compared with the space steps divided by the sound speed) because it then transforms any initial data into linear functions. In addition, this scheme smears out contact discontinuities. The purpose of this paper is to choose a scheme which is in some sense best and which still allows computation across the shock waves. This choice is made for linear equations and then by analogy the scheme is applied to the general equations of fluid dynamics. Following this scheme we carried out a large number of computations on Soviet electronic computers. For a check, some of these computations were compared with the computations carried out by the method of characteristics. The agreement of results was fully satisfactory.},

	abstract = {The non-linear evolution of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is a popular test for code verification. To date, most Kelvin–Helmholtz problems discussed in the literature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with increasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and severely limits the utility of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability as a test problem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the accuracy of their simulations based on ad hoc proxies, e.g. the existence of small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed two-dimensional Kelvin–Helmholtz problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. We show that in many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in Kelvin–Helmholtz problems. We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution using both athena, a Godunov code, and dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code. Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump (which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behaviour and are more computationally challenging. In the latter case, athena simulations are prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as resolution increases. Both athena and dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we include as supplementary material the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin–Helmholtz problems in this paper in machine-readable form.},

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the method is accurate and robust.},
